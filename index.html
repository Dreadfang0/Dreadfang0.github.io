				<h3>H8FUL</h3>
				<p>A Retrofuturistic Top-down shooter in which the player character is looking for his head through a variety of different buildings, after it swapped with an animal head.</p>

				<h3>Augur of Light</h3>
				<p>
					Augur of Light is a 1st person puzzle game, where you adventure in a Finnish island solving puzzles. During the first wave of covid-19 in Finland, we made this game as a school project about coping mechanisms for depression. We worked together with mental industry professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was mainly working on prototyping different puzzles and implementing them. I also worked on the particle effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game can be found <a href = "https://kim-k1mpp4-kupiainen.itch.io/augur-of-light">HERE</a></p>
				<p>
					Made with Unity.

				<h3>Valhalla Cannon</h3>
				<p>
					A project made on URHO3D with C++ for Android phones. Valhalla Cannon is an Angry birds like puzzle game where you shoot vikings from a cannon at different obstacles.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was mainly working on UI as the URHO3D editor was not really that good at anything, everything had to be placed via code. I also worked on implementing puzzles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Source code of Valhalla Cannon <a href = "https://github.com/GastaGaming/ValhallaCannon/">HERE</a>
					Made with URHO3D.

				<h3>Skeltal game</h3>
				<p>
					A project made for a summer course in 2019, where you shoot skeletons with a crossbow made out of bones in the wine cellar of a necromancer who happens to be your master. The game took part in Assembly Summer 2019's game dev competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					I mainly worked on the AI but I also dabbled a little on the VFX side.
				</p>
				<p>
